        "c0body": "We recently announced a beta for AI features in Figma Design. In this email, we are sharing our approach to building AI [https://www.figma.com/ai/our-approach/?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_ai_features] features and what\"s next.\n\nTo improve these features, we plan to start training AI models to understand design concepts, patterns, file structure, and tooling in Figma. Learn more about how your team can manage AI and our other updates below.\n\nMANAGING AI SETTINGS\n\nTeam admins can control how their teams use AI with two new settings for each\nteam they manage:\n\n * Whether your team can use AI features (on by default for Starter and\n   Professional teams).\n * Whether content is shared for AI training (on by default for Starter and\n   Professional teams).\n\nAI features and content training are optional. Teams can use AI features, even if content training is turned off. Read how to access your AI settings here\n[https: //help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/17725942479127-Control-AI-features-and-content-training-settings?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_ai_settings].\n\nThe content training setting goes into effect on August 15th, 2024. If an admin turns off content training after that, new content and edits will not be used to train AI models.\n\nNEW AI TERMS IN OUR POLICIES\n\nThe key updates to our Terms of Service [https://www.figma.com/legal/tos/?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_tos]\nand Privacy Policy [https://www.figma.com/legal/privacy/?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_privacy] do the following:\n\n * Allow Figma to use your team\"s content to improve AI features, when content training is set to \"on\"\n * Clarify that you retain your rights to content inputted into Figma AI and to the results generated\n\nThese new terms will go into effect on August 15, 2024. By continuing to use Figma, including keeping your files with us, you agree to these terms.\n\nIf you\"d like to read more about Figma\"s approach to AI, please visit our website [https: //www.figma.com/ai/our-approach/?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_ai_website].\n\nThank you for using Figma.\n\nThe Figma team\n\nNote: This is a legal notice, which is why you are receiving it even if you have opted out of Figma marketing and promotional emails.
